title: Final Project Requirements
---

#### Overview

The Course Project is worth a significant portion of your grade. It offers
you the chance to apply your newly acquired skills towards an in-depth
application. Keep in mind that teams will be expected to do
correspondingly larger projects. You should only form a 2+ person team if
you are planning to do an ambitious project where every team member will
have a large contribution.


#### Important dates

- Course project proposal: due **May 30th, 2021**.
- The final presentations date: **TBA**

#### Student projects from previous years
Use this list as an inspiration for your topic:
* Agent that plays the "Breakout" atari game
* Depth Map Prediction from a Single Image using a Multi-Scale Deep Network - implementation and comparison with original paper, experiments with improvements and results.
* [Check that](https://sites.google.com/view/clef2019-checkthat/task-1-check-worthiness)
* Facial expression recognition
* Generating image descriptions
* Short story generator
* Style Transfer of Non-Patterned Data


#### Datasets and interesting papers
You can see more information [here](../project-inspirations).

#### Project requirements

The project proposal is only for groups doing the choose-your-own final project.
Please submit one proposal per team (any member of your team can submit) to
the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/tsTdJpJohCNhSLzu5) by 11:59pm on May 30th.
You can not use late days for the project proposal.
It should contain the following sections:

**Team**: List the members of your team (names and Faculty Numbers)

**Problem Description (1-2 sentences)**: What is the problem that you will be investigating?
Data (1-3 sentences): What data will you use? If you are collecting new datasets, how do you plan to
collect it?

**Methodology/Algorithm (2-4 sentences)**: What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there
are existing implementations, will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such
implementations?

**Related Work (3+ prior works)**: Which papers will you read to inform your understanding of the
problem, and the appropriate methodology to tackle it?

**Evaluation Plan (2-3 sentences)**: How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results
do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or
compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?

**Minimal Requirements**: Does your project meet the following requirements?
• Dataset with at least 10,000 labeled examples (more will be needed for some tasks like machine translation
and 100-way classification).
• Dataset can be completely collected by the project milestone due date.
• Task is feasible: either prior work on the dataset exists or a human can get good accuracy on it.
• You have identified an automatic (i.e., can be computed by a computer) evaluation metric for the task.

If not, justify why your project will still be feasible.
