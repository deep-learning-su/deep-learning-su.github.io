title: Lab 2 - Intro to Tensorflow
---

In this exercise we are going to learn the basics of Tensorflow. We will see
implementation of logistic regression model, make it run in graph mode and
implement a neural network.

### Run online

**Recommended approach**: the lab excercise is available as a notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jw0pXhwqxqpXNdNN9KNUDU3aR9psPTrW?usp=sharing). Open the link and click on `Copy to Drive`. After that you can start editing and running your code.

### Run locally

Download the notebook from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jw0pXhwqxqpXNdNN9KNUDU3aR9psPTrW?usp=sharing) by clicking on `File -> Download .ipynb`. After this you need to have Jupyter ready in order to run the notebook. requirements.txt is currently not available for this excercise so you are on your own to resolve the dependencies which are used.
