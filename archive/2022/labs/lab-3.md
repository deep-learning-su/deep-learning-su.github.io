title: Lab 2 - Convolutional Neural Networks
---

In this exercise we are going to build a simple Convolutional Neural Network,
experiment with different filter sizes and at the end implement
[LeNet5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/).

### Setting up a local environment

For this exercise you would need Python 3.5+ installed with Tensorflow
and Jupyter Notebooks. In case that you haven't set up your environment yet,
please follow the instructions from [Lab 1](/labs/lab-1).

### Lab 2 Notebooks
Download the [zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14OxVcyLwY5IFGy7C18-utMbKNZqwIo06).
It contains one notebook:

- `lab-2.ipynb`

Place them in the directory or a subdirectory of the root of your Jupyter
Notebook server. Open both of them through Jupyter Notebook's web interface
(usually `localhost:8888`). Follow the instructions inside to complete the
problems.
