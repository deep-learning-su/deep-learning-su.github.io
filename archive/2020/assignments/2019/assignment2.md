title: Assignment 2 - Labs 1 & 2
---
Submission due date - **June 3rd, 2019**

This assignment is a combination of [Lab 1](/labs/lab-1) and
[Lab 2](/labs/lab-2). If you have already solved them during the lab classes,
you just need to submit them. In Lab 1 we cover data Preparation,
linear classification and tensorflow basics. In Lab 2 we focus on Convolutional
Neural Networks.

### Setting up a local environment

For this assignment you would need Python 3.5+ installed with Tensorflow
and Jupyter Notebooks. In case that you haven't set up your environment yet,
please follow the instructions from [Lab 1](/labs/lab-1).

### Assignment 2 Notebooks
Download the [zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-TFn9u1_hhYe4jJ1aXMfWIZRTbfZThNK).
It contains two notebooks:

- `lab-1.ipynb`
- `lab-2.ipynb`

Place them in the directory or a subdirectory of the root of your Jupyter
Notebook server. Open both of them through Jupyter Notebook's web interface
(usually `localhost:8888`). Follow the instructions inside to complete the
problems.

### Submitting your work:

Once you are done archive the modified notebooks in `assignment2.zip`. You can
upload your file to publicly accessible location and
then provide us a link using [this form](https://forms.gle/Rv2haZF3FBZvqhEg7)
or if you have a Google Account then you can directly upload the file and submit
using [this form](https://forms.gle/QseDvcycWiRRyk1C9).
