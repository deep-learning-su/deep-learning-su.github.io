title: Assignment 2 - Convolutional Neural Networks
---
Submission due date - **June 22rd, 2020**

In this assignment you have to build a simple Convolutional Neural Network,
experiment with different filter sizes and at the end implement
[LeNet5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/). Have in mind that for this assignment
you would need the notMNIST.pickle created in [Lab 1](/labs/lab-1). You can
obtain it by rerunning the given paragraphs without having to solve the
problems (although it is highly recommended to do it if you haven't already).

### Setting up a local environment

For this assignment you would need Python 3.5+ installed with Tensorflow
and Jupyter Notebooks. In case that you haven't set up your environment yet,
please follow the instructions from [Lab 1](/labs/lab-1).

### Assignment 2 Files
Download the [zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TNsr2wsEzP23JZuop1ldTofHUtLbEsIA).
It contains one notebook:

- `cnn.ipynb`

Place them in the directory or a subdirectory of the root of your Jupyter
Notebook server. Open both of them through Jupyter Notebook's web interface
(usually `localhost:8888`). Follow the instructions inside to complete the
problems.

*The `requirements.txt` might be slightly outdated. Please let us know in slack
if you have any issues and even if you have solved them. We would update the
file as soon as possible.*

### Submitting your work:

Once you are done archive the modified notebooks in `assignment2.zip`. You can
upload your file to publicly accessible location and
then provide us a link using [this form](https://forms.gle/6ME1NopMrgBd74FW7)
or if you have a Google Account then you can directly upload the file and submit
using [this form](https://forms.gle/8eEobBD7rWWjnznD6).
