title: Assignment 2 - Convolutional Neural Networks
---
Submission due date - **June 7th, 2020**

In this assignment you have to build a simple Convolutional Neural Network,
experiment with different filter sizes and at the end implement
[LeNet5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/).

### Run online

**Recommended approach**: the assignment is available as a notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1W-s2eEtxva-pnXZ0igeRMhKa2WYwrnMH?usp=sharing). Open the link and click on `Copy to Drive`. After that you can start editing and running your code.

### Run locally

Download the notebook from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1W-s2eEtxva-pnXZ0igeRMhKa2WYwrnMH?usp=sharing) by clicking on `File -> Download .ipynb`. After this you need to have Jupyter ready in order to run the notebook. requirements.txt is currently not available for this assignment so you are on your own to resolve the dependencies which are used.
