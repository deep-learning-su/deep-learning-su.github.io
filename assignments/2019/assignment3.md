---
Submission due date - **June 17th, 2019**


### Setting up a local environment

For this assignment you would need Python 3.5+ installed with Tensorflow
and Jupyter Notebooks. In case that you haven't set up your environment yet,
please follow the instructions from [Assignment 1](/assignments/2019/assignment1/).

### Assignment 2 Notebooks
Download the [zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CuoMXrEo3GnHmqtzRP0lvax8THPUjBKE).
It contains two notebooks:

- `1-word2vec.ipynb`
- `2-lstm.ipynb`

Place them in the directory or a subdirectory of the root of your Jupyter
Notebook server. Open both of them through Jupyter Notebook's web interface
(usually `localhost:8888`). Follow the instructions inside to complete the
problems.

### Submitting your work:

Once you are done archive the modified notebooks in `assignment3.zip`. You can
upload your file to publicly accessible location and
then provide us a link using [this form](https://forms.gle/ckhXAqPJgZBaDocd8)
or if you have a Google Account then you can directly upload the file and submit
